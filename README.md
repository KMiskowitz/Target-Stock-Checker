Checks in store levels for stock.

Uses Target's own API and API key that they use whenever you make a search on Target.com
This site provides accurate saleable and actual item counts from the stores. 
This is the exact same thing that Brickseek used before they entered into an agreement with Target to remove actual item counts from their website.

Obviously I've written this using some shoddy php code but the you can see the API calls that are made and can modify them to use whatever language you want.
